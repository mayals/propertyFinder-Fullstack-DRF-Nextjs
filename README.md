# 🏡 Property Finder Project(Work In Progress)
This is a full-stack property finder web application, inspired by platforms like Property Finder Saudi Arabia (you can change to any country).
It allows users to search, list, and manage properties for sale or rent, with features tailored to different types of users.

## ⚙️ Tech Stack
- Backend: Django REST Framework (DRF)
- Frontend: Next.js (React, TypeScript-ready)

- Deployment-ready with modular, scalable architecture.



## 🚀 Project Goal
The goal of this project is to create a scalable, role-based property listing platform where different user types can interact in a real estate ecosystem — just like on Property Finder.


## 🛠️ Usage Flow
Here’s how different users interact with the platform:
### Registration & Login
#### Buyers (normal users):
Can directly sign up and start browsing properties.
#### Developers, Brokers, and Agents:
Must first go to the “Join Us” page and submit an application form (with full name, email, job, experience, etc.).
The Admin team reviews the request.
If approved, the applicant receives a special registration link via email to create an account as a Developer, Broker, or Agent.
#### Admins: 
Created manually from the backend with full access rights.

## Property Listing
Developers, Brokers, and Agents can create property listings (with images, details, and pricing).

## Searching & Browsing
Buyers browse listings using filters (buy/rent, price range, location, property type).

## Connecting
Buyers contact Agents or Brokers for more details.
Agents respond on behalf of Brokers or Developers.

## Management & Control
Admins oversee the entire platform, review role requests, and manage users and properties.
